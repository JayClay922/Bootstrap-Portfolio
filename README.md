# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Project
This project required building my portfolio, again. However, this time building the layout using the 'Bootstrap CSS Framework' from scratch.

## Accceptable Criteria
The acceptance criteria for this project are, that using Bootstrap we have to recreate our site with the following items:-

1. A 'Navigation Bar', with the 'Navigation Menu' at the top
2. The 'Navigation Menu' should have working links that are applicable to my portfolio.
3. As mentioned above the links should navigate to the appropriate sections.
4. A 'Hero Section', using a jumbotron from 'Bootstrap' featuring my picture,my name, and any other information I'd like to include.
5. A 'Work Section' displaying my work in grid. Using 'Bootstrap Card' to display our work using placeholder image and name if needed. With an image of our work and a short description.
6. A 'Skills Section' detailing the skills we expect to gain from this bootcamp
7. Lastly, an, 'About me/Contact me' section, detailing a few things about me, and where and how to contact me.

## Outcome
Though this project was fairly easier with the help of 'Bootstrap CSS', it still came with it' challenges. However I did manage to arrive at a suitable outcome.

- I successfully used the 'Bootstrap CSS Framework' for the 'Navigation Bar' and menu, with different section headings such as 'Work', 'Skills' etc...







A section displaying your work in grid.

If you need to use placeholder image use placehold.coLinks to an external site.

Use Bootstrap cards for each project.

The description should give a brief overview of the work.

Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

An about/contact section
